# "listen" - string - default: "localhost:8080"
#
# The bind address that the server listens on. This can be a host address and a
# port formatted as ADDRESS:PORT, just an address formatted as ADDRESS, or just
# a port formatted as :PORT. If the address is missing, it defaults to
# 'localhost'. If the port is missing, it defaults to 8080. If this key is
# missing altogether, both are set to their defaults.
listen: localhost:8080

# "base" - string - default: "/"
#
# The base URI that all APIs are rooted on. If missing or blank, it defaults to
